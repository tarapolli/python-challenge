This Python Challenge encompasses two projects:
......
PyBank
This project runs a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company Using a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The results identify the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll
This project runs a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the results; see below. Ideally, this process will help this small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. Using dataset called election_data.csv, it contains three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
